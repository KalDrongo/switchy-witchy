Hey there!
This is a helpful little incantation to summon your switch configs
Just run gather-switch-secrets.py and it will put them into the /configs dir

### To make sure this dude works ###
1. Your scripts need to be able to transfer their configs over scp
   For HP switches the command [ip ssh filetransfer] enables this ability

2. Make sure you've logged onto these switches before!
   Or if you're fancy make sure you've gotten their keys
   into your ./ssh directory somehow (but I find logging into them easiest)

3. Put the names of your switches and their IPs into the switches.json
